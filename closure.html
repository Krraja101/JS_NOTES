      <i><u>Closure</u></i> :
    </h1>
    <li>
      The closure is a binding of parent function variables with the child
      function.
    </li>
    <li>
      This enables a JS programmer to use parent function member inside child
      function.
    </li>
    <li>EX:-</li>
    <p>
      function person() { <br />
      let a =21; <br />
      function age(){ <br />
      return a; <br />
      } <br />
      return age ;<br />
      } <br />
      let x= person() <br />
      log(x()); // 21
    </p>
    <li>
      The above example age is a nested function of person in age function we
      didn't declare any local variable, but still we are able to use variable a
      which belongs to person function this is achived by closure.
    </li>
    <p>
      <mark><b>NOTE-</b></mark>
    </p>
    <li>
      The binding of child/inner/nesetd function with its lexical
      environment(parent function state) is known as closure.
    </li>
    <li>
      Closure helps to achieve scope chain(lexical environment) from child
      function to parent function.
    </li>
    <li>
      Closure preserves the state of parent function even after the execution of
      the parent function is completed.
    </li>
    <li>A child function will have reference to the closure.</li>
    <li>When ever parent function is called a new closure is created.</li>
